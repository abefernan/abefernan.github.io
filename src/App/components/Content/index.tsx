            My name is Abel Fern√°ndez, but I go by <em>@abefernan</em> on some sites. I&apos;m a Frontend Developer who
            does remote work as a freelance.

            I currently live in Vigo, which also happens to be my hometown. It&apos;s a nice coastal city in
            northwestern Spain that I encourage you to visit.

            My main hobbies are geeky ones like playing videogames, watching films, or reading fantasy novels; but I
            also have a great time cooking and listening to music (sometimes at the same time). I also try to drag
            myself to the gym every now and then.

            I&apos;ve got a Computer Engineering background and I love learning all things that have to do with
            programming. Even if I&apos;m mostly focused on frontend web development (which I find <em>very</em>{' '}
            awesome), I try to read about current trends in other areas like DevOps from time to time.

          My most familiar knowledge and workflow have to do with making React apps and deploying them. Below you can
          find a list of technologies and tools that I&apos;m comfortable working with, but I&apos;m also very keen on
          picking up new ones.
